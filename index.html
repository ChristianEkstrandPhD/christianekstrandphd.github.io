                        Free will is inherently non-deterministic, meaning it cannot be fully explained by classical physics. However, it is also not entirely random, placing it beyond the scope of quantum mechanics. Does this suggest that an understanding of free will lies outside the boundaries of known physics? Unfortunately, most scientific publications offer little clarity on this question. Many are authored by philosophers who often present personal perspectives rather than grounded scientific analyses.

                        The motivation for this project is not to impose a particular viewpoint on free will but to explore it with an open mind, following where scientific inquiry leads. Our approach is rooted in the idea that free will must be a consequence of evolution, which is a well-regarded scientific discipline from which there exists plenty of empirical evidence. We are not the first to consider Darwinian evolution in discussions of free will. However, by integrating theories of evolution-driven decision-making with mathematical models of learning and game theory, our research leads us to conclude that free will is an illusion. We recognize that this is a bold and perhaps unsettling assertion, but it is the outcome supported by science.
