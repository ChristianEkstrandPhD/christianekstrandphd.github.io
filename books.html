                There is something wrong with physics. Natural assumptions of nature, based on observations, lead to nonsense equations. Also, our current fundamental understandings of nature, regarding quantum mechanics and gravitation, cannot be combined to a single theory. A detailed analysis suggests that spacetime is not what it seems for small scales. A new fundamental theory is needed. All this is well-known, but this book makes this information accessible to an audience beyond experts, namely to readers with a technical background and strong mathematical skills.

                To become a quantitative analyst at tier-1 investment bank, it is necessary to have a complete knowledge of derivatives pricing. There exists plenty of books for that purpose. To be complete and make an strong impact as a quantitative analyst, it is necessary to be able to apply this knowledge to the major asset classes: equity, commodities, interest rates, and foreign exchange. It is then necessary to read books for each individual asset class. This book fills this gap in existing literature: it provides the reader with a rigorous understanding of derivatives pricing as well as applying it to the various asset classes. It highlights similarities and differences between pricing methods in the different asset classes and provides the reader with the complete overview that is necessary for becoming a successful quantitative analyst.
