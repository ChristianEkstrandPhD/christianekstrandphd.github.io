                    There is something wrong with physics. Natural assumptions of nature, based on observations, lead to nonsense equations. Also, our current fundamental understandings of nature, regarding quantum mechanics and gravitation, cannot be combined to a single theory. A detailed analysis suggests that spacetime is not what it seems for small scales. A new fundamental theory is needed. All this is well-known, but this book makes this information accessible to an audience beyond experts, namely to readers with a technical background and strong mathematical skills.

    Christian Ekstrand’s <em>Financial Derivatives Modeling</em> is an exemplary resource for readers with a strong mathematical foundation seeking a comprehensive and rigorous exploration of derivative modeling across various asset classes, including equities, commodities, interest rates, and FX. For the mathematically proficient audience, particularly those working in quantitative finance, this book offers a perfect blend of theory and practical insight into derivative pricing, making it indispensable for professionals in roles such as quantitative analysts or academic researchers.
</p>

<p>
    The text covers an extensive range of derivative modeling topics, beginning with foundational pricing theories like replication methods, and progressing to more advanced topics such as skew and smile modeling, stochastic volatility, and exotic derivatives. The sections on skew and smile techniques are particularly valuable, providing a thorough examination of contemporary challenges and models used to capture market imperfections in volatility.
</p>

<p>
    What sets this book apart is its ability to present a deep, mathematically rigorous treatment of stochastic processes, including Lévy processes, local and stochastic volatility models, and high-dimensional derivatives. The chapters on interest rates and FX modeling are highly detailed, covering essential aspects such as yield curve construction, volatility surfaces, and calibration methods. Each topic is handled with the depth and precision required by advanced practitioners, while keeping a clear focus on theoretical integrity and practical applications in modern markets.
</p>

<p>
    Given the advanced mathematical content, Ekstrand provides compact and efficient summaries of core concepts like martingale theory and continuous-time modeling, which allow readers to quickly move beyond standard models like Black-Scholes and engage with more sophisticated frameworks. This pacing is a strength for the target audience, allowing experts to focus on the latest developments and nuances in derivative modeling.
</p>

<p>
    The book is structured in a way that facilitates both a systematic study and selective reading, where chapters on skew modeling, exotic derivatives, or asset-specific strategies can be accessed independently. The decision to omit implementation details (coding, programming) and focus solely on theoretical models further enhances its value for those seeking deep conceptual understanding, leaving model implementation as an exercise for the reader.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, <em>Financial Derivatives Modeling</em> is a standout text for experts with a strong mathematical background who require a detailed, theoretically robust guide to derivative pricing across various financial sectors. The clarity, breadth, and depth of its content make it an essential reference for professionals in quantitative finance, and it deserves a full endorsement for its target audience.
